TODO:
research beacon usability
laboratory blueprint
mining drill straight line blueprint
mining drill max density blueprint
calculate global economics
maybe add stone to bakery
modify nuclear reactor with combinator logic to save fuel
maybe separate (satellite production and rocket launch) from small factory
maybe separate mall from small factory
